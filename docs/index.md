# ModelMaker
Version 0.1, a VMD plugin for creating complete models with _Rosetta_

ModelMaker is an all-in-one modeling solution combining the strength of established
but often complicated to use modeling suits like _Rosetta_ and _Modeller_ with
MDFF in an easy-to-use manner in VMD. Integrative modeling approaches usually
aim to automate the process of structure analysis to avoid human bias, yet the
experience of structural biologists may be a desirable factor in structure refinement.
Therefore, ModelMaker uniquely allows for incorporation of user expertise by taking advantage of
interactive MDFF, allowing for manual manipulation of the structure.
